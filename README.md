## World Happiness Index and CO2 Emissions

The World Happiness Index measures countries by "happiness" and assigns an overall Happiness Score based on factors such as GDP per capita, Social Support, Life Expectancy, Freedom, Corruption etc. 

However, it does not take into account environmental factors such as CO2 emissions and energy consumption. The aim here is to verify if there is any correlation between a country's happiness index and its energy consumption and environment.

The null hypothesis here is that countries with a higher happiness score would ideally have lower CO2 emissions attributing to use of renewable sources of energy and a high environmental quality which could in turn impact overall happiness.
